# g_p_app

Our Graduation Project repository.

# Important Notice
Note: The application will not function as expected if cloned from this repository due to the backend APIs not being deployed on a server. We used ngrok during development to tunnel local backend APIs for testing purposes. As a result, the API endpoints are not accessible publicly.

## Reason
The backend team has not deployed the APIs on a server. Therefore, any attempt to run this application without the proper API endpoints will result in errors.

## Demo
To see the application in action, please check out the demo video available at the following link:
